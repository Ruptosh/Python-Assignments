    "Ans:- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses \n",
    "    objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like \n",
    "    inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept \n",
    "    of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single \n",
    "    unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "    Purposes:\n",
    "        1) The class is sharable, the code can be reused.\n",
    "        2) Data is safe and secure with data abstraction.\n",
    "        3) Polymorphism allows the same interface for different objects, so programmers can write efficient code."

    "Ans:- The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance.\n",
    "    In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute\n",
    "    definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.attr\n",
    "    where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object,\n",
    "    for the first attr it can find. Because lower definitions in the tree override higher ones, inheritance\n",
